        <h3>Sample Multi-Day Vacations</h3>
    <p>Our multi day vacations are planned and tailored to your interests. We normally start in Bozeman or Big Sky, MT, and plan your tour, activities, and lodging. We know the traffic patterns year round, we know the lodging (note in some areas the lodging is rustic). We tend to make big loops around the Yellowstone area, staying at different locations. This prevents 100’s of miles of backtracking, and allows your trip to be more active.</p>

    <p>Yellowstone is huge, larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined, and it can take hours to travel from one side to the other. Yellowstone’s visitation has increased dramatically over the past 10 years, and those traveling during the peak months will appreciate how much time one can save by not backtracking so much, and having an expert guide along to navigate the crowds for you.</p>
        
    <p>We can build in an activity day or two for you as well, planning extras such as whitewater rafting, ziplines, ski lift rides, fly fishing, horseback riding, golf and much, much more are available in the gateway communities. Day hikes into Yellowstone’s backcountry are another way to find solitude during Yellowstone’s busiest months (mid-May through late September).</p>
        
    <p>We try to find the best lodging available (let us know your price range), and the sooner in the season you book, the better our chances.</p>
        
    <p>How about a backpacking trip? There is no better to connect with the family than to put the gadgets down, and head into Yellowstone’s backcountry to get away from cell phones and other gadgets, and to explore the wilderness as a family. We offer easy overnight treks for ages 5 and up, to longer multi day trips. There are even wheel chair sites available. If you think Yellowstone has a lot to see along the roads, just imagine what’s waiting in the remaining 97% of the park. We offer the lightest rental gear available as well, so all you need to bring is personal gear. We have lightweight tents and sleeping bags, and backpacks available for use.</p>
        
    <p>We can build short 1 or 2 mile backpacking trips for easy camping, to cut down even more on the backtracking to hotels. Your guide will prepare your meals for you.</p>

    <p>Multi Day Packages include all Airport transfers (Bozeman Yellowstone International- BZM), private tours, park entrance fees and lodging. Meals and guide’s gratuities are not included. Alternate activities are only included when built into the package.</p>

    <p>We help you plan the trip you want to do with the activities you want to do. We are not just limited to the sample 2 day and 7 day packages shown here, let us know how many days, nights you have available, and we will put together a great vacation for you and your family.</p>

    <p><strong>Please note</strong> we charge $300 for vacation planning, which may be used towards a tour package.</p>
