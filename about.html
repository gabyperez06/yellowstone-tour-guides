    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class='about-info'>
        <p>As a non-corporate owned business, Yellowstone Tour Guides operates with a sole focus in Yellowstone Park Tours. We are proud to be one of the few companies left focusing on what we do best: <a href='index.html#tours'> Yellowstone Tours.</a>
        
        <p>Our small group tour system offers the chance for individuals and couples to have a private tour experience with a by the person rate. Of course private tours are available as well for those who want to customize their adventure. If you think about it, would you rather tour with a larger group of 10 to 40 people, or enjoy a small group of no more than 6 people with us?</p>
    
        <p>We also offer multi day private tour vacation packages, where we help you with every last detail of your adventure from lodging, tours, and alternate activities such as whitewater rafting, hiking, wildlife watching, ski lift rides, horseback riding and so much more. These packages really are the best way to get the most out of your Yellowstone vacation with the help of our local expert staff for planning.</p>
        
        <p>Unlike many of the other backpacking companies, we offer local guides who only guide in Yellowstone. Our guides have hiked most of the parkâ€™s 1200 mile trail system, we know the trails, the best campsites and we are able to help you plan a trek for you interests and needs. We can even tie a night or two into your multi day vacation if you want.</p>

        <p>We offer a very experienced guide team with 10 to 26 years experience for each guide, along with a couple of newer guides who are learning from our experts. We have found bringing new people on from time to time helps keep the enthusiasm alive with our entire staff.</p>
    
        <p>We welcome you to join us on one of our many sightseeing adventures in the winter or summer, to see the difference a small group makes compared to the larger impersonal buses and vans. Let us know what you are looking for in your Yellowstone adventure and we will be happy to help you out. You can always see more and do more with an expert guide than you can on your own. <a href='contact.html'>Contact us</a> today for more info.</p>
