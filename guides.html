    <h1>Meet Our Tour Guides</h1>
    <div class='first-item'>
    <p>Yellowstone is a very unique and scientifically complicated environment, and we are able to help you gain an under-standing of the active and sometimes violent geology for which the Park is famous. Kids are amazed as they learn about Yellowstone’s Caldera, one of the largest volcanoes in the world, while helping to spot wildlife. Our guides feel it is important to learn about Yellowstone as a whole including the wildlife, geology, the very primitive hot spring biology,forest ecology, and history, all of which play an important role in the Park’s ever changing ecology. Every one of our guides is fascinated by the Park and strives to continue their education to help enhance your visit.</p>

        <h3><strong>Jim Holstein</strong></h3>
        <p>Jim was raised in the area, and first worked in Yellowstone in 1987 at the Lake Hotel. In 1988 he worked for the Gallatin National Forest on the Gardiner Ranger District, getting involved with the historic fires of that summer.   After a couple of years of ski bumming in Big Sky, Jim then return to Yellowstone in 1991 as guide in the summer, and going year round shortly afterwards.   Jim has been backpacking in the GYE since the early ‘80s, and has hiked more than 400 miles of Yellowstone’s backcountry trail system.</p>
        
        <p><em>“As the years go by, I have enjoyed watching the evolution of this dynamic ecosystem, including the fires of ’88, the wolf reintroduction, along with a major change in Yellowstone’s winter use. I feel privileged to be able to be one of the handfuls of guides who lead trips 12 months a year, it’s amazing how quiet November and April can be before things get rolling for the winter and summer seasons. As the park’s visitation grows, I have been rediscovering the backcountry, and the solitude that is possible, even on the busiest of days.”  ~ Jim</em></p>

David is a former EMT, worked with the local K9 Search and Rescue, certified Avalanche III, and former backcountry ski guide.

He is nationally published photographer and has his work for purchase in galleries around Big Sky, MT.</p>
            
            <p><em>“I really enjoy being away from the hustle of the busy roads in order to capture a one of a kind image. I’m extremely excited for the backpacking photography workshops. It will be a great way to provide our guests with the opportunity to get their own unique images. In addition, show them more of less known beauty that Yellowstone has to offer.”  ~ David</em></p>
