    <div class='first-item'>
    
    <p>Yellowstone is a very large and complex park, and a local guide can make all of the difference on your trip. We do understand that many groups are traveling in one side of the park and out another, and with Yellowstone’s size being larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined, this can cause some complex logistics for step on guides. Rates may vary depending on where your guide begins or ends the trip. It is not unusual for us to have to drive a guide 3 hours, one way, to a pick up or drop off location. Our guides have driven big busses, and are aware where oversized vehicles can and can not go. Our guides will also keep up to date with Old Faithful’s prediction, so large amounts of time is not being wasted waiting for the geyser.</p>

    <p>Some important information for large bus groups: Yellowstone is very large and diverse, and impossible to see in a day. For those with 2 days planned in the park we recommend an Upper Loop and Lower Loop. For those with 1 day we recommend a Lower Loop. We recommend starting and finishing in West Yellowstone or Big Sky for the group’s convenience, if possible. The past couple of summers West Yellowstone has been filling and Big Sky is becoming a great option for busses for cheaper lodging and easy dinning options/ evening activities. We can also provide groups who are traveling in one side of the park and out the other.</p>
        
    <p>Also, in 2015 the restaurants have been overwhelmed at times, and we recommend a box lunch. We can help you arrange the best available lunches for your group and schedule in a bus friendly picnic area. Xanterra will not be comping guides and drivers starting in 2016, please make sure your employees know about this extra expense.</p>
        
    <p>Please request our questionnaire, we do ask a lot of questions, but we have found that we have been able to help several outside tour companies re-route their trip to avoid backtracking, roads that are not advisable for buses or are closed in the shoulder seasons. We have been in the Yellowstone area for over 40 years, and we can help you plan your trip some. This also allows us to make the most of your time and to give you some things to visit on the way out.</p>
