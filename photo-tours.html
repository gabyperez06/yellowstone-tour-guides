        <h3><strong>Spring Wildlife Photography Workshop</strong></h3>
        <p><em>Last week of May: End on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend 2021-2023</em></p>
        <p>This workshop will be focusing on Yellowstone in the springtime, which includes abundant wildlife, newborn wildlife and bears. This workshop will start and end in Bozeman, MT, making a large loop in through the West Entrance and out the North Entrance.
        As the snow breaks away from the high country, the lowlands are starting to burst with color from the wildflowers. The wildlife is still quite abundant, and many great shots are likely on this adventure.</p>
