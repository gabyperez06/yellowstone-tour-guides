    <h1>Backpacking Tours</h1>
    <div class='first-item'>
    <p>97% of Yellowstone is considered backcountry, and only 3 or 4% of the visitors make an effort to see the backcountry, and only a fraction of those folks spend the nightYellowstone Backpacking in the backcountry. Backpacking is a very rewarding and safe sport, as long as we follow proper bear etiquette. Traveling in larger groups is safer, and our expert guides, know the trails, and they know the rules for sleeping with grizzly bears and other wildlife. Very few people get to see Yellowstone’s backcountry, which by the way is filled with as many wonders as the front country, and our guides will get you to the best locations.</p>
    
    <p>Every year we schedule some of Yellowstone’s classic backpacking trips that are available by the person.  These trips include the dates and itineraries.  If you can’t make one of our group trips, you may schedule a private trip, to fit your schedule.  We highly recommend making backpacking reservations before March 1st of each year.</p>
    
    <p>Most backpacking trips will begin in Big Sky, MT, which is located 1 hour south of Bozeman and 1 hour north of West Yellowstone.  There are shuttles available from Bozeman if you choose not to rent a car.   There will be a 2 hour meet and greet the evening before the beginning of the Trek, and to hand out gear.</p>
    
    <p>Day one of the trek will begin at 6:00 am (sometimes earlier), with transportation provided to the trailhead.  We like to leave early so that we can experience Yellowstone’s front country before the crowds get rolling.  Each trek will take in a couple of Yellowstone’s main attractions on the way to and from the trailheads.  It is often a very peaceful trip to the trailhead, even during the busiest of times, without the traffic and a lot of wildlife.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Please note</strong> that backpacking trips may be altered due to trail closures, fires, flooding or other natural events.  In the rare occurrence that this happens, there are always some great alternatives in Yellowstone that we will take advantage of, each backpacking trip will come with a page with photos.</p>
