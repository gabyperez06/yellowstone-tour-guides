    <h1>January Winter Photography Workshop</h1>
    
    <div class='first-item'> 
        <p>This is a magical trip through Yellowstone’s winter wonderland. This is a time of year where, the crowds are low, the wildlife is abundant, and the scenes are out of a fairytale.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>This trip is open to all photographers, from amateur to expert. Local photographer and Yellowstone guide, David Reeves has been guiding and photographing in Yellowstone since 2007.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We will spend 3 days in the Northern Range and 2 days on snowcoach, traveling from the North to the West Entrance, giving you a full circle tour around the Gallatin Mountain Range. There will be a variety of Yellowstone winter scenes, including wildlife, waterfalls , geyser basins and landscapes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Enjoy Yellowstone in the winter at a slower pace, seeking out the best photographic opportunities. Because of Yellowstone’s size and slow modes of transportation in the wintertime, we will be moving around the area, cutting down our commute times.</p>
        <br>   
        <p>David has designed this workshop to capture the best of Yellowstone in the wintertime. This workshop is 6 nights of lodging and 5 days of touring.</p>
