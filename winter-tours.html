    <h3>Winter Wildlife Adventure - Early November through mid-April</h3>
    <p>If you have seen Old Faithful in the wintertime, and you want to see more animals, you may want to consider the Winter Wildlife Adventure.   We travel via Bozeman and Livingston to Yellowstone’s famed Northern Range, home to 70% of the park’s wintering wildlife. This trip will often see bigger numbers of animals (except humans), and a much larger variety of species. Elk, bison, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer, whitetail deer, eagles and coyotes are seen on almost every trip. Wolves are fairly common as well, and some trips in late March and early April will be treated with some of the first grizzly and black bear sightings of the year. We also visit one of Yellowstone’s most beautiful thermal features, Mammoth Hot Springs, where we almost always have the boardwalk to ourselves. Undine Falls, the Roosevelt Arch and the Albright Visitors Center and Museum round out a day full of wildlife. Most days we will see thousands of animals, both inside and outside the park. Departure times vary so that we can be in the right places at the right time of day.</p>

    <p>This section of Yellowstone is plowed and open year round, and snowmobiles and snowcoaches are not permitted in the portion of the park. The Northern Range is in the park’s lower elevations, and therefore receives less snow, which is ideal for wild animals to find food.</p>
        
    <p>Private Tours can make this trip more active by adding a cross country ski trek on the groomed Upper Terrace or Tower Falls trails. Early and late season trips may include a backcountry hike to be more active as well.</p>
        
    <p><strong>Common Wildlife:</strong> Elk, bison, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, mule deer, whitetail deer, eagles, coyotes are seen on most trips. Wolves and swans are common as well. Moose, grizzly bears and black bears have also been spotted on this trip on occasion as well. The bears become more common in mid March trough April.</p>
        
    <p><strong>Mileage:</strong> This trip is 300 to 380 miles round trip, depending on where we turn around.</p>
        
    <p><strong>Vehicles used:</strong> Mini vans and SUV’s</p>
        
    <p>For those touring from Big Sky, you may want to consider taking this tour at the beginning or end of your trip, and stay in Bozeman to save some windshield time, as we do have to travel through Bozeman to get to the Northern Range.</p>
        
    <p>Two day trips are available so that we can get you in the right locations at the right time, and so you can add cross country skiing, a soak in the Boiling River or a day hike. Photography Instruction is also available with 2-day trips.</p>
